        I started young making modifications to video games I loved, and
        branched into creating art for those modifications. Now I take that same
        creative energy and put it into creating applications that are easy to
        use, fun and functional. With my attention to detail and drive, I am
        excited to learn new things and try new approaches. Let's work together
        to make something awesome!
