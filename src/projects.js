    'A visual database built for Magic: The Gathering. Written in React with Sass for styling. I wanted to make an app that would be easy to use that could search all of the cards that have been made for Magic: The Gathering. It has a search feature that searches through all of the cards that have been printed for the game, using the Scryfall api I have taken the card data and loaded it into my own MongoDb database. With this app you can search cards by Name, manacost, set they belong to, and rarity.',
